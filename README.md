# Picogarden
Picogarden is a small PICO-8 game/toy about planting flowers.

## Keyboard controls:
* Arrow keys: move cursor
* X: open/close menu
* Z: perform selected action

## Instructions
Plant seeds, water them, and wait for them to grow.  
You won't know what plant you'll get until it finishes growing.  
Harvest them and get more seeds, or leave them there to
admire them. Harvesting partially grown plants is also possible, but
will yield fewer seeds.
